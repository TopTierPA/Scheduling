index.html is the file pulled when the site is visited. The code in this file is what should be updated if the iframe/map needs to be updated. 
In this code, rawData must be an empty object, and the postMessage javascript must be included in all updates. 

Also in this repo are a parent and child html template. These show how postMessage() works, which is the function that allows for data exchange to and from an iframe.
